# FocusPocus
Magically changing the page to keep you focused! A website-blocking productivity chrome extension.

Tired of productivity-related website blocking extensions that just show you an error page as their way of "blocking" a website? 

FocusPocus makes website blocking fun! All original content is fully loaded before it works its magic! With FocusPocus, images, videos, and even text are magically replaced gradually, making browsing blocked sites unbearable!

Hosted at http://focuspocus.netlify.app

Chrome extension is currently undergoing review but can be manually installed [here](https://github.com/LHL-FocusPocus/FocusPocus/releases).

This app was completed as the Final Project for Lighthouse Lab's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. 

Please note that the app is still in alpha build.

=========

<!-- ## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `final`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i` (in 'server', 'client', 'chrome-extension-react' directories)
4. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
5. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
6. Go to 'server' directory in terminal and type 'npm run local'
7. Go to 'client' directory in terminal and type 'npm start'
8. Go to 'chrome-extension-react' in terminal and run 'npm run build'
9. Go to Google Chrome url: chrome://extensions/
10. Click 'Load unpacked'. Navigate to 'chrome-extension-react/build' and select.
11. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` for and register.


## Warnings & Tips

- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them. -->

## Dependencies

- Node 10.x or above
- NPM 5.x or above
