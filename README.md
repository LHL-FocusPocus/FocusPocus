# About the Project
FocusPocus

A quirky productivity app + Chrome extension that replaces all images/videos on time-wasting sites (Reddit, Facebook) instead of blocking them outright. Includes data visualization and social aspects to keep you motivated on your quest to cut down on bad browsing behaviour.
