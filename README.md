# FocusPocus
Magically changing the page to keep you focused! A website-blocking productivity chrome extension.

Tired of productivity-related website blocking extensions that just show you an error page as their way of "blocking" a website? 

FocusPocus makes website blocking fun! All original content is fully loaded before it works its magic! With FocusPocus, images, videos, and even text are magically replaced gradually, making browsing blocked sites unbearable!

Chrome extension is currently unlisted but can be installed from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/focus-pocus-extension/ognhkeempdpgnfkliplegljejeakonlg).

This app was completed as the Final Project for Lighthouse Lab's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
